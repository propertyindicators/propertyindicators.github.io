    "about": "We are an independent group of experienced professionals in fields of business analysis, statistics and software development. Our goal is to combine the experience in applied mathematics, software development with practical experience in valuation and real estate activities.",
    "miss": "Analysis, design, and implementation of modern IT tools for business, especially in areas that, for various reasons, remained insufficiently covered by IT technologies. We conduct a system analysis of market needs and current trends in the IT industry for a synthesis of effective solutions for a wide range of subject areas.",
    "prj": "At now a task of the project is to raise the IT infrastructure of the real estate market of Ukraine to a new level. Our site is an experimental place (laboratory) for the design and implementation of various information services and software modules. Any graphics, diagrams, tables and forms that you can find on this site can be placed on any website in a variety of design solutions. Complex statistical systems, programs, and databases that are the \"foundation\" of our statistical observations can be adapted and integrated (as specific software modules) into a business workflow of companies professionally working with real estate and in related markets. We are open for communication and will be happy to consider any suggestions of using our products and experience."
