Expertise: provide clinical, financial & operational experts who enable & accelerate improvement
Engagement: attract, develop and retain world-class team members by being a best place to work
Job Summary
The Health Catalyst Data Operating System is a major evolution of our Enterprise Data Warehouse. DOS enables hospitals to process both real-time and batch data, integrate AI and SQL, and create, find and reuse healthcare content like populations, measures, value sets etc.

Metadata API (drives the DOS metadata driven EDW)
Discovery API (provides service discovery within DOS)
Access Control UI (a UI that allows customers to grant users access to application in DOS)
Data API (future, a service that allows secure access to data in the EDW)
The goal of this set of microservices is to provide third party developers inside and outside Health Catalyst with the building blocks necessary to build health care applications on top of DOS. By providing these common services, we can allow other developers to focus on the business problem their application solves, rather than the common functionality that all health care applications require.
Previous experience in a healthcare-related organization is desired but not essential.

Work closely with the Product Manager to prioritize new features and bugs.

Work with DOS leadership to establish the strategic direction of the Fabric team within the overall vision of DOS.
Collaborate and communicate with other team leads across DOS to coordinate feature dependencies and gather feedback on Fabric services
Own the authentication and authorization infrastructure across DOS, including managing access, provisioning authentication infrastructure for an environment, and evolving our authentication service.

Data: integrate data in a flexible, open & scalable platform to power healthcare’s digital transformation
Analytics: deliver analytic applications & services that generate insight on how to measurably improve
Expertise: provide clinical, financial & operational experts who enable & accelerate improvement
Engagement: attract, develop and retain world-class team members by being a best place to work
Health Catalyst, the leader in healthcare analytics & data warehousing, is building a first-of-its-kind application platform for healthcare.
Today 80% of what every healthcare application does is the same: Ingest data from an EHR (Electronic Health Record), insurance claims and other data sources Run analytics or machine learning on the data to come up with insights Create a UI to show the insights and to allow users to act on the insights Try to integrate the insights into the EHR workflow of the clinicians
In reality, most applications fail to implement all these pieces and many even struggle with the first step of getting access to data about patients. No wonder technology has failed to achieve its potential in healthcare.
The Health Catalyst Data Operating System (DOS), is designed to provide this functionality out of the box so application developers can focus on the 20% that is unique about their application. At over 250 hospitals and 2,500 clinics that already use HealthCatalyst to manage over 65 million patients, hospital IT teams or 3rd party software vendors will be able to use these APIs to access data about patients without needing to integrate with the EHRs, to run analytics and machine learning in real-time, to build web and mobile UIs and to show their UI inside EHRs.

About the job
Whether you're on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product's journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you'll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.
As a company, we have increased our commitment to create a Product Area with dedicated leadership and resources to build out a full product portfolio and brand. In many ways, as Head of Content Operations, you will be joining a few years-old “startup,” with the resources of Google behind it.
Our Hardware Marketing Operations team works with Marketing teams to build effective strategy, operationalize that strategy in the form of marketing plans/briefs, and then deliver against those plans on time, on budget, and at quality.
The Head of Content Operations will be responsible for leading three interconnected, yet different functions: Localization, managing the end-to-end localization process. Content Operations, strategizing on the right content for the right time/campaign, clearing all selected content, and ensuring usage rights are documented and communicated. Content Management, ensuring the cleared, approved assets are managed appropriately and ‘findable’ by the intended users and managing content communications.
Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself. Responsibilities
Lead global marketing process improvements to create scalable localization and content operations supported by marketing workflows, tools, and technologies. Lead the development of a Global Digital Asset Management tool for the Devices and Services (D&S) Marketing Organization.
Partner with cross-functional teams to advocate for global partners, generate insights, initiate programs, and drive international experience and localization decisions.
Create and continuously improve international launch processes in collaboration with business partners.
Build partnerships with key organizations within D&S and identify opportunities to increase an international and strategic content mindset. Build the core processes needed to support the flow of content from creator to end-user.
Work with Marketing/Creative partners to plan content acquisition/usage across the business. Manage access/permissions to ensure the right content is available to the appropriate parties at the appropriate time.
At Google, we don’t just accept difference—we celebrate it, we support it, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our products and our community. Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. See also Google's EEO Policy and EEO is the Law.
